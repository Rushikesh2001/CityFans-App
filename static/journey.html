          <div class="title">Manchester City's First Major Honour</div>
          <div class="info">
            City gained their first honours by winning the Second Division in
            1899; with it came promotion to the highest level in English
            football, the First Division. After 5 years of promotion, they went
            on to claim their first major honour on 23 April 1904, beating
            Bolton Wanderers 1–0 at Crystal Palace to win the FA Cup. The
            showpiece match of English football's primary cup competition, the
            Football Association Challenge Cup (better known as the FA Cup), it
            was the 33rd Cup final, and the tenth at Crystal Palace. Each team
            progressed through four rounds to reach the final. Manchester City
            were a First Division team chasing a league and cup double; Bolton
            Wanderers were a mid-table Second Division team. Consequently, most
            observers anticipated a Manchester City win. In a close match
            featuring strong defensive play, Manchester City won 1–0. The goal,
            scored by Billy Meredith, was disputed by those with Bolton
            sympathies, who believed Meredith to be offside. The victory gave
            Manchester City their first major honour.

            Double One-off FA Cup Triumph and First Division Title

          <div class="info">
            In the 1930s, Manchester City reached two consecutive FA Cup finals,
            losing to Everton in 1933, before claiming the Cup by beating
            Portsmouth in 1934. During the 1934 run, the club broke the record
            for the highest home attendance of any club in English football
            history, as 84,569 fans packed Maine Road for a sixth-round FA Cup
            tie against Stoke City – a record which stood until 2016. The club
            won the First Division title for the first time in 1937, but were
            relegated the following season, despite scoring more goals than any
            other team in the division. Twenty years later, a City team inspired
            by a tactical system known as the Revie Plan reached consecutive FA
            Cup finals again, in 1955 and 1956; just as in the 1930s, they lost
            the first one, to Newcastle United, and won the second. The 1956
            final, in which the Blues defeated Birmingham City 3–1, saw City
            goalkeeper Bert Trautmann continuing to play on after unknowingly
            breaking his neck.

          <div class="info">
            In the summer of 1965, the management team of Joe Mercer and Malcolm
            Allison was appointed. In the first season under Mercer, Manchester
            City won the Second Division title and made important signings in
            Mike Summerbee and Colin Bell. Two seasons later, in 1967–68, City
            claimed the league championship for the second time, beating their
            close neighbours Manchester United to the title on the final day of
            the season with a 4–3 victory at Newcastle United. Further trophies
            followed: City won the FA Cup in 1969 and a year later triumphed in
            the European Cup Winners' Cup, defeating Górnik Zabrze 2–1 in the
            1970 final. This was the club's only European honour until their
            triumph in the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League. The Blues also won the
            League Cup that year, becoming the second English team to win a
            European trophy and a domestic trophy in the same season. The final
            trophy of the club's most successful period of the 20th century was
            won in 1976, when Newcastle United were beaten 2–1 in the League Cup
            final. A long period of decline followed the success of the 1960s
            and 1970s. The club were twice relegated from the top flight in the
            1980s (in 1983 and 1987), but returned to the top flight again in
            1989 and finished fifth in 1991 and 1992 under the management of
            Peter Reid. However, this was only a temporary respite, and
            following Reid's departure Manchester City's fortunes continued to
            fade. City were co-founders of the Premier League upon its creation
            in 1992, but after finishing ninth in its first season they endured
            three years of struggle before being relegated in 1996. After two
            seasons in the First Division, City fell to the lowest point in
            their history, becoming the second ever European trophy winners to
            be relegated to their country's third-tier league after FC Magdeburg
            of Germany.

          <div class="title">Recovery and Two Takeovers</div>
          <div class="info">
            After relegation, the club underwent off-the-field upheaval, with
            new chairman David Bernstein introducing greater fiscal discipline.
            Under manager Joe Royle, City were promoted at the first attempt,
            achieved in dramatic fashion in the Second Division play-off final
            against Gillingham. A second successive promotion saw City return to
            the top division, but this proved to have been a step too far for
            the recovering club, and in 2001 City were relegated once more.
            Kevin Keegan replaced Royle as manager in the close season, and
            achieved an immediate return to the top division as the club won the
            2001–02 First Division championship. The 2002–03 season was the last
            at Maine Road and included a 3–1 derby victory over rivals
            Manchester United, ending a 13-year run without a derby win. In the
            close 2003–04 season, the club moved to the new City of Manchester
            Stadium. The first four seasons at the stadium all resulted in
            mid-table finishes. Former England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson
            became the club's first foreign manager when appointed in 2007.
            After a bright start, performances faded in the second half of the
            season, and Eriksson was sacked on 2 June 2008; he was replaced by
            Mark Hughes two days later. By 2008, Manchester City were in a
            financially precarious position. Thaksin Shinawatra had taken
            control of the club the year before, but his political travails saw
            his assets frozen. Then, in August 2008, City were purchased by the
            Abu Dhabi United Group. In December 2009, Mark Hughes – who had been
            hired shortly before the change in ownership but was originally
            retained by the new board – was replaced as manager by Roberto
            Mancini. City finished the season in fifth position in the Premier
            League, narrowly missing out on a place in the Champions League but
            qualifying for the UEFA Europa League.

          <div class="info">
            Continued investment in players followed in successive seasons, and
            results began to match the upturn in player quality. City reached
            the FA Cup final in 2011, their first major final in over 30 years,
            after defeating derby rivals Manchester United in the semi-finals,
            the first time they had knocked their rival out of a cup competition
            since 1975. The Blues defeated Stoke City 1–0 in the final, securing
            their fifth FA Cup and the club's first major trophy since winning
            the 1976 League Cup. On the last day of the 2010–11 season, City
            beat out Arsenal for the third place, thereby securing qualification
            directly into the Champions League group stage. Strong performances
            continued to follow in the 2011–12 season, but poor form in second
            half of season by City and then successive wins at the end of season
            saw City and arch rivals Manchester United with equal points on the
            final day. Despite the Blues only needing a home win against Queens
            Park Rangers, a team in the relegation zone, they fell 1–2 behind by
            the end of normal time. However, two goals in injury time – the
            second by Sergio Agüero in the fourth added minute – settled the
            title in City's favour, making them the first team to win the
            Premier League on goal difference alone. The following season, City
            were unable to replicate the previous year's success by finishing
            second in league title and losing in FA cup final which saw sacking
            of Mancini. He was replaced by Chilean manager Manuel Pellegrini. In
            Pellegrini's first year in charge, City won the League Cup and
            regained the Premier League title on the last matchday of the
            season. The team's league form then slowly declined over the next
            couple of years, as the Blues finished second in 2014–15 and then
            dropped to fourth in 2015–16, although the 2015–16 season would see
            City win another League Cup title and reach the Champions League
            semi-finals for the first time.

            Pep Guardiola, former head coach of Barcelona and Bayern Munich, was
            confirmed to become Manchester City's new manager on 1 February
            2016, with the announcement having been made several months before
            Manuel Pellegrini left his position.Pep Guardiola, former head coach
            of Barcelona and Bayern Munich, was confirmed to become Manchester
            City's new manager on 1 February 2016, with the announcement having
            been made several months before Manuel Pellegrini left his position.
            Guardiola's first season in Manchester would end trophyless, with
            the Blues placing third in the league standings, but the following
            season proved far more successful, as City won the Premier League
            title with the highest points total in history and broke numerous
            other club and English league records along the way. This would
            prove to be the start of a period of unprecedented success for
            Manchester City under Guardiola. Between the 2017–18 and 2022–23
            Premier League seasons, City won five out of possible six league
            titles, only finishing second behind Liverpool in the 2019–20
            season. Guardiola also guided the Blues to silverware in domestic
            cup competitions, highlighted by four consecutive League Cup
            triumphs in 2018–2021. During the 2018–19 season, City completed an
            unprecedented domestic treble of English men's titles. Apart from
            winning all three of the major English football tournaments, they
            also won the Community Shield, the first time any team has ever held
            all four of England's primary football trophies at the same time. On
            the continental stage, the club achieved breakthrough in 2020–21,
            reaching their first-ever Champions League final. In an all-English
            affair, City lost 0–1 to Chelsea at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto.

            their maiden Champions League title at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium
            in Istanbul against Inter Milan, thereby assembling a rare feat –
            the continental treble. The road to the Champions League victory
            included wins over European giants Bayern Munich, who were defeated
            4–1 on aggregate, and Real Madrid, who suffered a 1–5 aggregate loss
